# 3D
My personal project from 2022 focused on 3D scanning, modeling, animating, tokenisation and other procedures connected with 3D models. 

## Scanning:

The scanning process was easy and fun. Here's the result after I ruined the texture:

## Animation:
I animated models using different techniques. The friend of mine I scanned didn't in fact know how to do the breakdance 1990's hand-spin.

## AR:
The animated models even came to my apartment for a cup of coffee and some karate.

## NFT-fication:

I created publicly available NFTs from the scanned models. You can check the created NFTs here: https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/7391340270041753477166579945582474602241659856117240743732390567778524856321. 

I will be tokenizing other models as well, so keep up to date with my NFTs profile: https://opensea.io/CrystalettoGrandes. You can't buy them from my OpenSea profile, however you still can contact me and purchase it using my web App.
